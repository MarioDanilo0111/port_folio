This project was bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your machine.

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/MarioDanilo0111/port_folio.git]
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd [port_folio]
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or, if you use Yarn
yarn install
```

### Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:3000. Open the URL in your browser to view
the application.

### Production Build

To create a production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

After the build process completes, you can start the production server with:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

### Linting

To run ESLint to catch linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

### Static Export

To export your application as static HTML, which can be run standalone without the need for
a Node.js server:

```bash
npm run export
# or
yarn export
```

This will generate a `_static`folder with the exported static files, which you can deploy to any
static hosting service.
